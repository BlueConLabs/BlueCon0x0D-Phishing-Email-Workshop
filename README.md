# Description
Phishing continues to be the leading cause of initial access in major breaches ‚Äî accounting for over 75% of intrusion pathways globally. In this hands-on workshop, the CyberLynk team will demonstrate how attackers leverage phishing infrastructure and malware-laced payloads to bypass traditional controls.

Together, we will:
- Deconstruct malicious phishing emails
- Analyse headers, embedded links, and attachments
- Use dynamic tools to safely test payloads
- Map attacker techniques to MITRE ATT&CK (Initial Access + Credential Access)
## ‚úÖ Workshop Objectives
- Understand common phishing TTPs (Tactics, Techniques & Procedures)
- Manually analyse and validate malicious indicators
- Perform dynamic email threat analysis in a controlled lab
- Learn tooling and scripting to build repeatable phishing detection workflows
## üéì Learning Outcomes Attendees will leave with the skills to:
- Analyse phishing attempts with precision
- Identify and extract indicators of compromise
- Apply threat intel to enrich and validate findings
- Build their own phishing response SOP (Standard Operating Procedure)
## üèÜ Prizes Participants can win:
- Sponsor giveaways
- CyberLynk training discounts or lab access
- Recognition for top phishing analysis
